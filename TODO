- langpanel: the icon used for the languages is "applications-internet" which
  displays a globe in default icon theme, but could display something really
  irrelevant in an other icon theme;
- langpanel: the languages menu has an horrible scroll effect at opening.
  That's GTK magic that I don't know how to workaround: when poping up a
  ComboBox, GTK places the selected entry under the cursor, thus not displaying
  the whole menu where I want it to be;
