Custom GDM greeter for Tails: 
http://tails.boum.org/todo/TailsGreeter/

Security note:

In order to properly localize console sudoers.d/tails-greeter-console file installed into /etc/sudoers.d
This file allows to run setupcon script (without arguments) as root. 
This approach seems to be secure as long as setupcon script is secure.
Because this script is intended to be run as root we're relying on Debian's security audit for
console-setup package. 
The script is executed with every user login via .profile
N. B> username ``amnesia'' is hardcoded into it.
